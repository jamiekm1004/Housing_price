# Housing Price Analysis

A data analysis project predicting housing prices using **Python**. 
This project explores key factors influencing housing prices, applies feature engineering techniques, and builds machine learning models to generate predictions.

## Features

- **Data Exploration:**
  - Loaded and explored a dataset with 20,640 housing records, including features like location, age, number of rooms, and median income.
  - Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends and visualize correlations between features.

- **Data Preprocessing:**
  - Performed one-hot encoding for categorical variables and standardized numerical features using `StandardScaler` to improve model performance.
  - Addressed missing data and ensured consistency across features.

- **Modeling:**
  - Implemented and trained linear regression models using **Scikit-learn** to predict housing prices.
  - Visualized model coefficients to identify the impact of features on housing prices.

- **Visualization:**
  - Used **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** to create scatter plots, correlation heatmaps, and feature importance charts.

## Key Insights

- **Income and Housing Prices:**
  - Median income showed a strong positive correlation with housing prices, indicating it as a key predictor.
  
- **Feature Contributions:**
  - Features like the number of rooms and location had varying levels of influence on housing prices.
  
- **Model Performance:**
  - The linear regression model provided baseline predictions and revealed the need for more complex models to capture nonlinear relationships.
